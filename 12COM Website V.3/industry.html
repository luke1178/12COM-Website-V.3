            <h1>Industry Barriers for Women</h1>
             <p class="bannertext">Hey, did you know that even though there's a huge demand for IT jobs, girls often don't get as much of a chance to shine in the field? Here are some reasons why:

        <div class="body-content">
                <section class="image-text">

                                <div class="image-text-text larger-text">
                                    <h2 class="div">Stereotypes and Bias:</h2>
                                    <p class="paragraphs">
                                        Sometimes, people assume girls aren't into techie stuff or aren't as good at it. These assumptions can make it tougher for girls to get hired or feel comfortable in tech jobs.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2 class="div">Lack of Role Models:</h2>
                                    <p class="paragraphs">
                                        It's hard to picture yourself in a job when you don't see many people who look like you doing it. Girls often don't see enough women in IT roles, which can make it seem like it's not for them.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2 class="div">Education and Training:</h2>
                                    <p class="paragraphs">
                                        Not everyone has access to the same opportunities to learn tech skills. Girls might not get as many chances to study STEM subjects or get the resources they need to learn tech stuff.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h2 class="div">Work-Life Balance:</h2>
                                    <p class="paragraphs">
                                        Tech jobs can be pretty demanding, with lots of long hours and tight deadlines. Balancing work and other stuff, like family, can be tough for anyone, but especially for girls in IT.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2 class="div">Workplace Culture:</h2>
                                    <p class="paragraphs">
                                        Some workplaces aren't very welcoming to girls, with issues like harassment or a lack of chances to move up. It's important for everyone to feel safe and supported at work.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2 class="div">Lack of Mentorship and Networking:</h2>
                                    <p class="paragraphs">
                                        Girls might not have as many chances to connect with people who can help them out in the tech world, like mentors or networks of other women.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="paragraphs">It's super important to break down these barriers and make the tech world more inclusive for everyone. That could mean things like setting up mentor programs, making sure everyone gets fair opportunities, and creating a workplace where everyone feels respected. By tackling these issues, we can make sure girls have the same shot as anyone else at rocking it in the tech industry and bringing fresh ideas to the table!
